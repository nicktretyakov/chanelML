Download a real ONNX model (like ResNet-50):
wget https://github.com/onnx/models/raw/main/vision/classification/resnet/model/resnet50-v2-7.onnx -O resnet50.onnx

Modify the code to skip model loading for testing by creating a dummy implementation
Use a different model path if you already have an ONNX model file
